# 👋 Hey there, I'm Mashrafi Nano.

🔥 A relentless coder and future-ready **Machine Learning Engineer** & **Software Architect** in the making.  
I don't just learn tech—I **go deep, break it, and rebuild it better**.

💻 Currently mastering:
- Low-level control with **C/C++**
- Expressive power with **Python**
- Efficient thinking with **Algorithms & Data Structures**

🚀 My battlegrounds:
- 🤖 **ML & AI** — where logic meets intuition
- 🧠 **System Design** — building things that scale
- ⚔️ **Competitive Programming** — solving problems with precision (Codeforces | LeetCode | AtCoder)
- 🌐 **Full-Stack Dev** — designing both logic & visuals

💡 Philosophy:  
*"Every line of code I write brings me closer to the engineer I’m becoming."*

📫 Reach out: **miwanrobin@gmail.com**  
⚡ Fun Fact: *I debug in my dreams — and sometimes wake up with the fix.*

📈 I’m not here to just code.  
I’m here to build, break limits, and become **dangerously good**.
