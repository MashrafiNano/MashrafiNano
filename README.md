# Hey there, I'm Mashrafi Nano.

 A relentless coder and future-ready **Machine Learning Engineer** & **Software Architect** in the making.  
I don't just learn tech—I **go deep, break it, and rebuild it better**.

 Currently mastering:
- Low-level control with **C/C++**
- Expressive power with **Python**
- Efficient thinking with **Algorithms & Data Structures**

 My battlegrounds:
- **ML & AI** — where logic meets intuition
- **System Design** — building things that scale
- **Competitive Programming** — solving problems with precision (Codeforces | LeetCode | AtCoder)
-  **Full-Stack Dev** — designing both logic & visuals

 Philosophy:  
*"Every line of code I write brings me closer to the engineer I’m becoming."*

Reach out: **miwanrobin@gmail.com**  
⚡ Fun Fact: *I debug in my dreams — and sometimes wake up with the fix.*

 I’m not here to just code.  
I’m here to build, break limits, and become **dangerously good**.
